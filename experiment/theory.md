Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity, commonly used in most programming languages. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only that is top. Arrangement of plates is a good example of stack. Whenever we want to ask an element in somewhere between the stack we have to go through the top elements first. This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. The element added first is to be removed last.. In stack terminology, adding an item to the stack is called PUSH operation and removing an item from the stack is called POP operation.<br><br>

<b>Basic Operations</b><br>
1.push-aadingan a item into a stack on top.<br>
2.pop- Deleting  an item from top of the stack.<br>
3.peek-check the last or top element in the stack.<br>
4.IsEmpty- check if stack is empty.

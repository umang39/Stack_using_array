<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

To implement various operations of stack with the help of array .

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

In computer science, a stack is a last in, first out(LIFO) abstract data type and data structure. A stack can have any abstract data type as an element, but is characterized by only two fundamental operations, the push and the pop.

A collection of items in which only the most recently added item may be removed. The latest added item is at the top. Basic operations are push and pop. Often top and is Empty are available, too. Also known as "last-in, first-out" or LIFO.

We will try to mimic both push and pop operation with the help of array by adding or removing the element from starting index. 

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

This experiment is useful for the students of 2nd year  as well as the faculty members who are involved in teaching-learning process of the course in Data structure.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

Data structure using c lab as per second year curriculum of AKTU.


<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

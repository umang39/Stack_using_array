#### 1. Focus Area : reinforce theoretical concept

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>recall the concept of array.|Remember| recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>explain the concept of stack. | understand |explain

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository for experiment
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
User will recall what the satck is and what is LIFO .They will see how we can  push an element to the stack and pop an eliment from the stack using the most dynamic data structure array.user can give an input to initialise the eliments and he will able to see how the array do this initialization in stack in the same manner it will do with the deletion of the element.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will able to: <br>recall the concept of array. | On simulator screen, user read the definition  <br> and description of the array | What kind of Data Structure is Array? <br>A.Non-Linear <br> <b>B.Linear<b/>.
2.| User will be able to: <br>explain the concept of stack.|On simulator screen,user will come through the basic operations of the stack |Q1. What will be the correct order after pushing "Z" in the stack given below: <br>X,Y,P,Q <br>A. Z,X,Y,P,Q<br>B. X,Y,Z,P,Q <br> <b>C. X,Y,P,Q,Z</b> <br>D. P,Q,X,Y,Z .<br> Q2. What will be the correct order after poping in the stack given below: <br>X,Y,P,Q <br>A. Y,P,Q<br>B. X,P,Q <br> <b>C. X,Y,P</b> <br>.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| User will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will apear on screen with option like<br> Push,Pop,Sort etc  | To ask what do want to in this simulator first
2.| Student will select an option among <br> push, pop,sort etc| On screen,it will show a empty Satck or a randomly partialy filled Stack| The initial set-up of satck
3.| User will provide  one or <br>more than one inputs in simulator| simulator will take input to perform the opration selected perviously by user. | To provide the inputs to start operation
4.|user will click on Submit button| Simulator will display the stack after operation| To see the result of operation
